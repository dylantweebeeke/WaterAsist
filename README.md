For a school project we have to make an innovative product with the environment in mind. For our idea we have an app which needs to take down the use of water.

#Code conventions
To make working together as easy as possilble we need to make some rules for the coding. These are very simplistic:
  -Make sure the indentation is right
  -If you write some not self explainatory code : comment what you are do. In this way the other team members can understand what you are    trying to do.
  -ALWAYS PULL before you start coding!!!
  - If there is some duplicate code which needs to be replaced, always check with the teammembers which code can be replaced.
  
Language code is: Java.
